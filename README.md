## Time Series Forecasting for Energy Consumption: Optimizing Resource Allocation in Smart Grid Systems

## Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model for predicting energy consumption
patterns in smart grid systems. By leveraging historical data on energy usage, weather
conditions, holidays, and other relevant factors, the model seeks to forecast future energy
consumption accurately. The goal is to optimize energy distribution and resource allocation,
enabling efficient management of electricity grids. By forecasting energy consumption patterns,
this project contributes to reducing costs, improving grid reliability, and promoting sustainability in
energy management.

## Expected Outcome:
● Development of an accurate time series forecasting model for energy consumption.
● Optimization of energy distribution and resource allocation in smart grid systems.
● Reduction in operational costs and improved grid reliability.
● Enhanced sustainability through efficient energy management practices.

## Conclusion:
This project explores various time series forecasting models for predicting energy consumption. Techniques implemented are data splitting, model training, hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV, and evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R^2. They can help discover valuable insights in this dataset. By analyzing evaluation metrics, we can select the most suitable model for forecasting future energy consumption based on our specific requirements.
